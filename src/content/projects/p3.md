title: Designing with users
description: In this project, we look at how to design with users, using Trekanten as the focus. To discover a  problem to work with, we interview users of Trekanten and conduct a mixture of a thematic analysis and affinity diagramming to discover which direction the project goes in. Over three iterations of the problem, and with the help of users, we design a digital solution to the problem of payment in the MakerSpace. We use sketches and prototyping to eventually reach this design. The final design prototype is both functional and aesthetic, and attempts to answer the problem statement that we discovered with the help of the users.
