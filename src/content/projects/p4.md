title: Creating GuildMiners
description: We had the task of constructing and evaluationg an interactive, digital application with the intention of connecting people. We decided to create a mobile game using Unity and C#. We succeeded in making a working prototype of a game with multiple features. Our evaluation was done by having six participants playtest the game for a week, and then answering a questionnaire. Our findings were the game was fun to play, but we did not find the game to facilitate the theme of connecting people.
