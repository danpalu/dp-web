title: Creating a motion controller for Overcooked!
description: This project focused on designing physical controllers for games or serious play. Our objective was to create a controller for the game ”Overcooked! 2” that would enhance the gameplay experience through the incorporation of motion controls. In order to meet this goal, we conducted research on current solutions and gathered data on relevant issues. We then used this information to establish the problem statement for our controller and developed one or more physical prototypes using Arduino’s and incorporating movement. The performance of these prototypes was subsequently evaluated against a regular Xbox controller. The end result of our evaluation showed our controller made Overcooked! 2 more enjoyable through the use of motion controls.
