title: Generating routes to facilitate neighborhood exploration.
description: We created an application that generates routes based on user-selected points of interest (POI). We utilize various APIs, including OpenRouteService, a route generator built on OpenStreetMap, and Google Places,  which retrieves images of POIs. After developing the first iteration, we conducted an evaluation to assess the overall user experience and get a System Usability Score (SUS). From this, we identified features for the final iteration of the application. Upon completing the second iteration, we conducted a comparative evaluation using the same methodology as the first evaluation.
